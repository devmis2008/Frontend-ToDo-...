**Data Merging Requirements**

• Specify the "Info" column clearly and merge the information into the action button.

• Merge the "Assigned Date" and "Due Date" fields into a single field labeled "Completion Timeline."

• Merge the "Submission Date" and "Submitted" fields into a single field labeled "Submission Timeline."

• Merge the "Checked Date" and "Checked" fields into a single field labeled "Checked Status" or "Final Review."

• Merge the "User ID" and "Name" fields into a single field labeled "User Details" or "User Identity."

**Terminology and Field Modifications**

• Remove the "Add" button from all modules.

• Replace the term "Secondary" with "Alternate."

• The "Contact Number" field should not be mandatory in the Library module.

These guidelines should be followed to ensure consistency and a better user experience across all modules.
